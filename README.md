# Shredder-Machine
Hand detection using TensorFlow object detection API.

Many factories, small businesses, and individuals use shredding machines. Shredders use sharp grinding metal teeth to rip paper/waste apart. If not used correctly it can cause a serious danger to the person using it. When the paper/waste is jammed in the machine, people attempt to remove it and get their fingers caught in the blades. The goal of this model is to detect the hand position in order to prevent the presence of a person hand near cutting elements of the shredder.
